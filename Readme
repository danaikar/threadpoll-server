main(): 
The main function creates the master thread and the worker threads and waits for them to finish.

masterThread(): 
In General the function:
1. Sets up a socket
2. Listens for incoming connections
3. Buffers the connections onto a shared buffer

More specific this function is responsible for accepting incoming connections. This is being accompilshed via a socket, which is being added to the buffer if there is space in it and the condition variable is signaled to notify the worker threads that there is a new connection. Otherwise it puts the thread to sleep until space is available.

workerThread():
In General the function:
1. Receives client connections from the buffer
2. Updates the poll statistics
3. Updates the polllog file

More specific this function waits until a connection is available in the buffer. When this happens it recieves a message with the name, surname and the vote from the client and after checking for double-voting it updates the pollStats and the pollLog files. 


-----pollSwayer.c--------------------------------------------------------------------------

main(): 
The main function creates a thread to send votes to the server and waits for it to finish.

sendVote(): This function is responsible for sending votes to the server. It opens the input file and for each line (containing a name, surname, and vote), it creates a socket and initiates a connection with the server. It constructs a message and sends it to it.
